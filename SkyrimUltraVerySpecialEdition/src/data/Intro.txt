You wake up. You sit in a horse car, three other people are next to you.
A strong man with long blond hair speaks to you.
Ralof: 	\"Hey, you. You're finally awake.\"
	\"You were trying to cross the border, right?
	Walked right into the Imperial ambush, same as us,
	and that thief over there.\"
He's pointing with his Head to the other man in the carriage, which is beeng gaged.
Lokir: \"Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along.
	Empire was nice an lazy.\"
	\"If they haden't been looking for you,
	I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell.\"
	\"You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here.
	It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants."
Ralof: 	\"We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.\"
An Imperial is looking back und shouts:
	\"Shut up back there!\"
Lokir is looking to the forth men in the horse car, which has ben gagged, and says:
	\"And what's wrong with him, huh?\"
Ralof replayed enraged:
	\"Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.\"
Lokir says shocked:
	\"Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion.\"
	\"But if they've captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us?\"
	\"I don't know where we're going, but Sovenguarde awaits."
Lokir replayed scared:
	\"No, this can't be happening.\"
Ralof:	\"Hey, what village are you from horse thief?\"
Lokir:	\"Why do you care?\"
Ralof:	\"A Nord's last thoughts should be of home.\"
Lokir:	\"Rorikstead. I'm ... I'm from Rorinkstead."
The Imperial Soldier is calling the General:
	\"General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!\"
The General is saying sharp:
	\"Good. Let's get over this over with.\"
