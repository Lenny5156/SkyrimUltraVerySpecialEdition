2. Then open a Terminal an navigate with "cd" where the game is.
3. Execute java -jar "Name of The application"
4. Have fun playing it :)

## What is SUVSE

SUVSE is an recreation of the popular RPG The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim from Bethesda as an Console-Application.
It will featrue most of the Quests, Locations and beautiful ASCII-Arts.

## The Team

We are 2 students currently learning Java and big fans of Skyrim. 
We don't have much freetime so it might take a while until it is finished.

## Our goals

We want to create our own version of Skyrim.
It should be finished when The Elder Scrolls 6 is out.
Explore more of Skyrim by researching for this project.
