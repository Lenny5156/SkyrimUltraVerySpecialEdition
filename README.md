# SkyrimUltraVerySpecialEdition (SUVSE)

We are trying to make a new version of Skyrim for everyone.

## What is SUVSE

SUVSE is an recreation of the popular RPG The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim from Bethesda as an Console-Application.
It will featrue most of the Quests and Locations and will feature beautiful ASCII-Arts.

## The Team

We are 2 students currently learning Java and big fans of Skyrim. 
We don't have much freetime so it might take a while until it is finished.

## Our goal

We just want to have fun programming it and make the wait for The Elder Scrolls 6 shorter.

## Infos about the Project

We are developping it in Eclipse.
We try to document it as good as we can.
If you find any bugs or differences with the original please contact us.
